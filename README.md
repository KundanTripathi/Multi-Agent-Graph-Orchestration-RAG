# 🚀 Multi-Agent Graph RAG
A modular, multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using graph-based orchestration, powered by Flask, LangGraph, LangChain, ChromaDB, and OpenAI APIs.

## Application
    -- *Fast Retrieval Augmented Generation* - for LARGE ENTERPRISE with petabytes of data and multiple Segments of functions/business<br>
    -- *Optimized Rtrieval of Content* - using Heirarchial Knowledge Graph and Segmentation<br>

## 📊 System Architecture
### 🧠 Graph Workflow
The multi-agent system leverages a LangGraph flow for orchestrating document retrieval, agent collaboration, and final response generation.

## 🌐 Flask Web Application
The front-end Flask app provides an interactive interface to query documents using the RAG system.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
🐳 Docker – Containerization for easy deployment

🌐 Flask – Lightweight web framework for UI and API

🧠 OpenAI API – LLM-powered agents for query understanding and response generation

🧬 ChromaDB – Vector database for fast document search and retrieval

🔁 LangGraph – Graph-based orchestration of multi-agent logic

🔗 LangChain – Integration layer for LLM workflows and tools


## Order of Execution 
1. embed_files.py -  Creates Embedding Vectors and Stores in ChromaDB with HNSW Graph Based storage and retrieval<br>
2. docker-compose - "docker compose up --build" :- It compose/creates docker container with all the dependendencies and host the Flask App<br>

## Higlights
-- The Langgraph Graph Builders does following steps:<br>
    -- *Classify Query* - It classifies query into the folder structure<br>
    -- *Router* - Routes the query to different agents specifically looking at the context specific to the query<br>
    -- *Agents* - Retrieves Context with effiecient HNSW Graph Nodes and Edges of Vector DB and passes both Query and Context for response from LLM<br>
